These style guides are copies of Google's internal style guides to
assist developers working on Google owned and originated open source
projects. Changes should be made to the internal style guide first and
only then copied here.

Unsolicited pull requests are not accepted and will be closed without
comment.

If this PR does anything other than update a style guide with changes
already made to the internal copy, please do not create it.
